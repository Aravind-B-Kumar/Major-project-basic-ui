# **Adaptive Marine Species Identification with Open-Set Detection and Incremental Learning**

This project presents an automated marine species identification system designed to support sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, and marine biodiversity monitoring.
The system processes underwater images captured by ROVs, AUVs, or public datasets and uses advanced deep-learning techniques to detect, classify, and **adaptively learn new species over time**.
